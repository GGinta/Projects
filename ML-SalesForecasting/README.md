# Retail Store Sales forecasting using ML models and Deep Learning.

The data set for this notebook was provided by a retail store Rossmann and was found on the Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales). Rossman operates over 4,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. The objective of this project is to create a Regression ML model that can accurately predict daily sales for multiple stores for three months. I chose to use the r2 score to measure my models' performance and show how well my features explain the variations in sales. I will also look at the Mean Squared Error to see if it improves with different models.

- Sales Forecasting Model:  XGBoost and Linear Regression Machine Learning models
- Sales_Forecasting Deep Learning: TensorFlow sequential Model
