Twitter Sentiment Analysis: Elon Musk


The objective of this project is to create a machine learning model that analyzes text (tweets) taken from Twitter and labels them as positive, negative or neutral. For this project, I've chosen to analyze tweets containing the words "Elon Musk" to understand the general attitude towards him and his recent twitter takover. The limitations of the project is that it only contains over 300k tweets and were taken over two days. New developments and actions taken by Elon could change people's attitudes
